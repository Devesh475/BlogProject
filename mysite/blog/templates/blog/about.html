<h1>About this company</h1>
<p>This is a free website for posting blogs for the superusers and anyone can comment on it.</p>
<br>
<p>It took me quite a long time to develop this blog webapp since I am really new to Django.</p>
<br>
<p>The technology used in front end is purely html and css.</p>
<br>
<p>The technology used in back end is Django.</p>
