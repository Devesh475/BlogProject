# GoBloging

* In this project we have included the facility of multi-author blogs, which will allow
the bloggers to interact even with the more people of the same interest.
* One of the key feature of the website designed is that a visitor is able to add a
comment to any post made by the blogger (i.e. doesnâ€™t need to be a blogger).
* There is a separate admin interface for the superuser of the website to directly do
the all the change that can be done by the blogger plus some additional
functionality.
* Link to other websites such LinkedIn and GitHub, etc. are also available in the
navbar of the website.
* Contact page and about section link has also be provided in the navbar for
communication purpose and other details.
